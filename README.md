# When-Was-the-Golden-Age-of-Video-Games-
Search for a golden age of video games by identifying release years that users and critics liked best
</p>
<p>In this project, we'll explore the top 400 best-selling video games created between 1977 and 2020. We'll compare a dataset on game sales with critic and user reviews to determine whether or not video games have improved as the gaming market has grown.</p>
<p>Our database contains two tables. We've limited each table to 400 rows for this project, but you can find the complete dataset with over 13,000 games on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/holmjason2/videogamedata">Kaggle</a>. </p>
